# resources

It's hard to find good, up-to-date information about python for LibreOffice. Luckily, there is one exception: [Christopher Bourez's guide](https://christopher5106.github.io/office/2015/12/06/openoffice-libreoffice-automate-your-office-tasks-with-python-macros.html).

You might also need to browse the [LibreOffice API reference](https://api.libreoffice.org/docs/idl/ref/servicecom_1_1sun_1_1star_1_1sheet_1_1Spreadsheet.html). Sorry.
